# Fast Console

## Introduction
The "Fast Console" is a simple yet powerful web application designed to emulate a JavaScript console in a web browser. This tool allows users to input JavaScript code and view outputs directly on the web page instead of the standard developer console. It's an excellent tool for teaching, presentations, or testing JavaScript code snippets in real-time.

## Features
- **Custom Console Output**: Redirects `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` outputs to the web page.
- **Interactive Code Execution**: Allows users to run JavaScript code and see the results immediately.
- **Styled Output**: Error and warning messages are highlighted.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: Easy-to-use interface for coding and viewing outputs.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fast-console.git
   cd fast-console
   ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the Fast Console.

## Usage

- **Writing Code**: Enter your JavaScript code in the textarea provided.
- **Running Code**: Click the `Run` button to execute the code. The console output will appear in the black log area below.
- **Printing Output**: To print the output directly after running the code, click the `Print` button. This will display both the input and the evaluated result.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML document structure.
- Embedded `<style>`: Defines CSS for styling the application.
- Embedded `<script>`: Contains JavaScript for overriding console functions and handling button clicks.

## Security Warning

This application uses `eval()` to execute JavaScript code provided by the user. While convenient for a controlled environment, `eval()` can potentially run malicious code and should be used with caution, especially if adapting this project for broader use where inputs might be taken from untrusted sources.
